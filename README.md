## Overview

This project aims to analyze customer data to identify distinct segments within the customer base. By understanding these segments, businesses can better target their marketing efforts, customize products or services, and improve overall customer satisfaction.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains information about customers, including demographics, purchase history, campaign responses, and more. It consists of 2240 entries and 29 features.

## Data Preprocessing

Before performing analysis, the dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, converting data types, creating new features, and removing outliers.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA involves exploring the dataset to understand its distribution, relationships between variables, and identifying patterns. Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots are used to gain insights into the data.

## Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are applied to reduce the number of features while preserving important information. This helps in visualizing high-dimensional data and improving clustering performance.

## Clustering

The K-means clustering algorithm is used to group customers into distinct clusters based on their similarities. The optimal number of clusters is determined using methods like the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.

## Analysis of Clusters

Each cluster's profile is analyzed based on income, spending behavior, campaign responses, and other relevant factors. Insights are drawn to understand the characteristics of different customer segments and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

## Conclusion

Customer segmentation analysis provides valuable insights into the customer base, allowing businesses to make data-driven decisions and enhance customer relationships. By understanding the needs and preferences of different customer segments, businesses can optimize marketing campaigns, improve product offerings, and ultimately drive growth.
